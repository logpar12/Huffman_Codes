# Huffman_Codes
PURPOSE: Create Huffman codes for a txt file

Description:
1. The program will ask for the file name. The txt file should be 
placed in the program source code folder. An example "story.txt" is 
placed there for convienence.

2. The program will then output the number of total characters for "int n"
and sperate the characters and frequeiencies into vectors under "Summary"

3. The program will then find the huffman codes.

4. The program will print the codes and make the "encoded.txt" file

5. The program will then decode the "encoded.txt" file and make a 
"decoded.txt" file which should be the original "story.txt"
